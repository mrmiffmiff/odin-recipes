The HTML Recipes Project for the Odin Project

The purpose of this repository is to fulfill the requirements of the Odin Project's Recipe Project. This will mainly test my foundational HTML skills that I've learned through the Odin Project and Colt Steele's videos.

Mainly practiced basic HTML structure, with paragraphs, links, images, lists, and some basic accessibility style elements. No form control, but Odin hasn't covered that the way Colt did in his HTML section. Perhaps they'll cover it later for JavaScript stuff.
